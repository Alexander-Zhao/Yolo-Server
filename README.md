# Yolo-Server
Yolo-Server to detect objects from any image

Combining my app-building skills with AI, I utilized the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect vehicles and pedestrians at intersections. The model efficiently processes photos of traffic captured by my mobile app, identifying objects such as cars, trucks, and people in each image. Based on the total counts, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the waiting time for pedestrians and vehicles at each intersection. For instance, if few cars are present, it reduces the pedestrian wait time, preventing lengthy delays similar to those I have experienced.

This is what the goal of the app was:

This is how the system communicates between each section:
